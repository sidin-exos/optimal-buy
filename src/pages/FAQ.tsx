  {
    id: "tariff",
    question: "What is the right tariff for me?",
    answer: `Pick the SMB (small-medium business) option if you're in a small-to-medium sized business, responsible for commercial transactions, and need distilled procurement best practices tailored to your business case each time.

Pick the Pro option if you're a full-time procurement professional who needs to run multiple simulations almost every day to improve decision-making and save significant time. We also recommend Pro for CFOs and business owners who are responsible for high-value decisions and need 24/7 best-in-class support.`,
  },
  {
    id: "data-privacy",
    question: "How do you ensure commercial data privacy?",
    answer: `Our internal engine is fine-tuned to identify and encrypt commercial data before sending it to external APIs. For the Enterprise tariff, we can deploy our engine on your server, giving you full visibility and control over all outgoing API requests.`,
  },
  {
    id: "fine-tuned-scenarios",
    question: "What do you mean by fine-tuned procurement scenarios?",
    answer: `Each scenario is enriched with industry-specific context, category expertise, and real-time market intelligence before analysis. EXOS validates your inputs against best-practice business cases, applies grounding from live market data—including trends, risk signals, and pricing benchmarks—and clearly flags its limitations when information is insufficient. The result is a decision-ready report, not a generic AI response.`,
  },
  {
    id: "limited-requests",
    question: "Why is the number of requests limited in the SMB option?",
    answer: `EXOS is not designed to be creative but to provide best-in-class expertise. Each of your requests is enhanced with business knowledge, scenario fine-tuning, structured XML prompts, grounding, and validation after receiving an API response. This means your request goes through multiple checks before it returns to you. EXOS gives you straightforward answers, pointing out its limitations if it doesn't have sufficient data.`,
  },
  {
    id: "price-comparison",
    question: "Why is the price higher than ChatGPT or Gemini?",
    answer: `EXOS is not a mass product—it's designed for professionals seeking the best possible quality. For each request you make, we've run dozens of scenario simulations to improve quality, reduce hallucinations, and empower EXOS with best business practices.`,
  },
  {
    id: "market-intelligence",
    question: "How does Market Intelligence work?",
    answer: `Market Intelligence continuously scans trusted sources to deliver real-time insights on suppliers, commodities, regulations, and industry trends. Every finding is stored in your private knowledge base—never shared externally—and automatically used to enrich your analytical reports with live market data, risk signals, and pricing benchmarks. The more you use it, the sharper your decision support becomes.`,
  },
  {
    id: "fine-tuning",
    question: "Can I get EXOS fine-tuned for my purposes?",
    answer: `Absolutely. We offer fine-tuning and customisation for every Pro and Enterprise user. Pro users can request one custom scenario and one custom dashboard per month. Enterprise users get fully custom analytics and dashboards, the ability to upload their company knowledge base into the system, and regular market intelligence reports configured to continuously improve analysis quality.`,
